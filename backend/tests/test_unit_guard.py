"""Unit-contract guard for the CD fixing at the engine boundary.

This is the test that would have caught the 2026-07 PnL-Trace cliff on day
one (DIAG_PNL_TRACE.md): the fixing store is DECIMAL, and value_booked_trade
must consume it verbatim. The floating settlement is asserted against a
hand-computed analytic value at tight tolerance, so EITHER failure mode of
the percent/decimal contract moves the result by ~100x and fails loudly:

  - a double division (engine divides an already-decimal fixing by 100):
    settlement collapses to ~1/100 of the analytic value;
  - a missing division (engine treats the decimal as percent and scales up,
    or a caller pre-multiplies by 100): settlement balloons to ~100x.

Fixture arithmetic (all hand-computed, no engine helpers):
  trade 2025-04-15 -> effective (T+1 KR business day) 2025-04-16
  reset R = 2025-04-16 -> fixing date F(R) = R - 1 Seoul BD = 2025-04-15
  quarterly schedule -> first pay 2025-07-16, i.e. accrual = 91/365 ACT/365
  notional 10bn, CD fixing 2.51% == 0.0251 decimal
  floating stub settlement = 10e9 * 0.0251 * 91/365 = 62,578,082.19 KRW
